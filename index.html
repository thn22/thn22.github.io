    Hi! My name is Ethan. I'm 25 years old and currently in the Data Science and Analytics
    Bootcamp through Northwestern University. My goal upon completing this program is to
    get hired as a Data Analyst. I am currently undecided on what field within data Science
    I would like to work in.
  </p>
  <p>
    A little background info on me: I am residing in Madison, Wisconsin. I graduated in 2021
    from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a Bachelor's of Science in Zoology. My 
    original plan was to become a physical therapist, but the opportunity to pursue flight 
    school changed my plans. I attended Gateway Technical College's Aeronautics program for 
    one year before deciding being a pilot wasn't for me. That brought me to the world of 
    data science and analytics.
